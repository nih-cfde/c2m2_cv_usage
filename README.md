# Generating Controlled Vocabulary from C2M2
This repository is to create the data requested in this Help Desk inquiry: [https://cfde.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/HELP/queues/custom/4/HELP-262](https://cfde.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/HELP/queues/custom/4/HELP-262)

Relevant text:

We previously worked with Amanda Charbonneau to get information on tissue blocks that could be RUI registered, see https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-ui/rui/  

We also need Uberon terms, see Amandaâ€™s earlier data compilation at

### Commands ran

```
# create conda environment

conda create -n deriva -y python==3.9

# activate and install deriva
conda activate deriva
pip install deriva

# run the script
python c2m2_cv_usage.py
```

Then I get the error message:

```

Traceback (most recent call last):
